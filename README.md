MTD SMS
==========

MTD SMS is a mashup providing real-time bus departure times via text message for Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District buses. This service improves on the official CUMTD text message service by allowing users to retrieve departure times by intersection or landmark rather than a difficult-to-remember stop code.

The project is in limited alpha status with several known issues but a live demo can be reached by texting 217-9199MTD (217-919-9683). Please send feedback to mtd\_sms@sunahsuh.com
